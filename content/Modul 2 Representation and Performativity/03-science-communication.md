> [!info] About this module
> 
> This module is an experiment, where Sarah Tober and Andreas Siess were giving lectures on *Representation and Performativity in Science Communication* in front of engineering students at BITS Pilani in India. Therefore the content is mainly in English and addresses the specific needs and affordances that this experiment demanded. 

## Science communication and performativity

> ‚ÄúBy failing to discuss with nonscientists what they are doing, scientists not only endanger society but limit themselves and their research in a number of ways. They may fail to perceive directions that would be profitable to their work;¬†they may fail to convince funding bodies that what they are doing has any economic or social value;¬†they may be left with no control over what is done with their research;¬†and they will almost certainly be diminished as people.‚Äù ((Haynes 1994, 5)[^1]

It is important to consider what to communicate (facts, theories, concepts, methods etc.) but also how
performativity of science communication is crucial (formats, language, gestures, self-presentation, interaction etc.)

## Assignment

How would you suggest science/your discipline should be communicated towards a lay audience? (format, mode, language, scale, interaction etc.)

üìë Please brainstorm in your group and document your ideas in your Google doc.

## Looking at the pros: Hollywood

- Hollywood productions often aim at a broad audience
- Science plays an important role in many movies and series
- In the genre of disaster movies, especially natural scientists and engineers often play a special role, their expertise is needed to ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù
- Example: 4 scenes from different disaster movies¬†

üìë Please have a look at the presentation of the scientist characters and their way of communicating. How would you describe them (attributes, characteristics, looks etc.)? What makes the communication successful?
Document your notes in your shared Google doc

## A deeper look into stereotypes

The character of ‚Äúthe scientist‚Äù is a quite common movie trope.
But: after closer look science characters can be portrayed quite differently in pop culture in general and in specific films in particular
