> 
> This module is an experiment, where Sarah Tober and Andreas Siess were giving lectures on *Representation and Performativity in Science Communication* in front of engineering students at BITS Pilani in India. Therefore the content is mainly in English and addresses the specific needs and affordances that this experiment demanded. 

> â€žDie UniversitÃ¤t sollte ein Ort sein, an dem autonome Individuen und WeltbÃ¼rger hervorgebracht werden bzw. sich selbst hervorbringen.â€œ (Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1810)

The university is envisioned as a space where autonomous individuals and global citizens are cultivated, empowering students to shape their own intellectual identities. In line with this vision, we, as lecturers, are committed to fostering an environment of interactive dialogue rather than merely delivering monologic lectures in which students are passive listeners. We strive to create a participatory learning experience that encourages active engagement, critical thinking, and mutual exchange of ideas.

Guided by the Humboldtian ideal of education, we aim to dissolve hierarchical distinctions between lecturers and students. We regard ourselves and our students as equal partners in the pursuit of knowledge, where each perspective is valued and contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues. This egalitarian approach emphasizes collaborative inquiry and positions every participant as a researcher contributing to the collective intellectual endeavor.

## Transforming students into researchers
To facilitate this collaborative learning process, each session will include small tasks and brief homework assignments designed to encourage critical reflection and active participation. Our ultimate goal is to inspire students to embrace the role of researchers, cultivating their analytical and investigative skills. In alignment with common academic practices, students will engage in maintaining a research diary or journal, which serves as a reflective tool to document their evolving thoughts and insights throughout the course.

## Concept: research journal
Furthermore, students will be organized into groups to contribute to a collective research journal, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility for knowledge production. This collaborative exercise not only reinforces the research ethos but also enhances students' ability to articulate their ideas and engage in constructive dialogue. Through this approach, we aim to cultivate a vibrant academic community that nurtures curiosity, critical inquiry, and the development of independent, globally minded scholars.

Since the main audience were engineers, it makes sense to have a look at one of the 'first engineers' in history: Leonardo da Vinci and his famous notebooks.

## Format of the journal's content
Main goal: gathering ideas, data, sketches, photos, screenshots, observations
Format: Rather unstructured, we do not want to give you too much specifications
ðŸ‘‰ This journal will be your graded submission for this module
Your advantage: You wonâ€™t have a huge assignment at the end of our sessions. Simply update your journal regularly and you will be fine.
You will work in small groups so you can support each other and discuss your ideas.
