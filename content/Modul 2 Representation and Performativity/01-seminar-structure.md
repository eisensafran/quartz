> 
> This module is an experiment, where Sarah Tober and Andreas Siess were giving lectures on *Representation and Performativity in Science Communication* in front of engineering students at BITS Pilani in India. Therefore the content is mainly in English and addresses the specific needs and affordances that this experiment demanded. 

## Warmup

‚ùì Quick brainstorming: What are the first aspects/points/images that come to your mind when you hear the phrases: engineering, technology, science, the humanities?

## Form/format of this seminar

> ‚ÄûDie Universit√§t sollte ein Ort sein, an dem autonome Individuen und Weltb√ºrger hervorgebracht werden bzw. sich selbst hervorbringen.‚Äú (Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1810)

The university is envisioned as a space where autonomous individuals and global citizens are cultivated, empowering students to shape their own intellectual identities. In line with this vision, we, as lecturers, are committed to fostering an environment of interactive dialogue rather than merely delivering monologic lectures in which students are passive listeners. We strive to create a participatory learning experience that encourages active engagement, critical thinking, and mutual exchange of ideas.

Guided by the Humboldtian ideal of education, we aim to dissolve hierarchical distinctions between lecturers and students. We regard ourselves and our students as equal partners in the pursuit of knowledge, where each perspective is valued and contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues. This egalitarian approach emphasizes collaborative inquiry and positions every participant as a researcher contributing to the collective intellectual endeavor.

## Transforming students into researchers
To facilitate this collaborative learning process, each session will include small tasks and brief homework assignments designed to encourage critical reflection and active participation. Our ultimate goal is to inspire students to embrace the role of researchers, cultivating their analytical and investigative skills. In alignment with common academic practices, students will engage in maintaining a research diary or journal, which serves as a reflective tool to document their evolving thoughts and insights throughout the course.

## Concept: research journal
Furthermore, students will be organized into groups to contribute to a collective research journal, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility for knowledge production. This collaborative exercise not only reinforces the research ethos but also enhances students' ability to articulate their ideas and engage in constructive dialogue. Through this approach, we aim to cultivate a vibrant academic community that nurtures curiosity, critical inquiry, and the development of independent, globally minded scholars.

Since the main audience were engineers, it makes sense to have a look at one of the 'first engineers' in history: Leonardo da Vinci and his famous notebooks.

## Format of the journal's content
Main goal: gathering ideas, data, sketches, photos, screenshots, observations
Format: Rather unstructured, we do not want to give you too much specifications
üëâ This journal will be your graded submission for this module
Your advantage: You won‚Äôt have a huge assignment at the end of our sessions. Simply update your journal regularly and you will be fine.
You will work in small groups so you can support each other and discuss your ideas.
Please form groups of about 3‚Äì4 persons

Each group creates a shared Google Doc  
üëâ this will be your common research journal
Make sure to put all the group members‚Äô names in the header of the first page

> We recommend telling participants specifically as soon as they have to complete a task in Google doc. For this reason, we have always chosen a small icon üìë on our presentation slides when a task is to be completed in writing. 
> We also differentiate between assignments that are to be completed immediately during the seminar and assignments that serve as homework. To differentiate between these two types, either a time limit or the note ‚Äúhomework‚Äù is placed after each assignment. This time specification can also implicitly convey how deeply the participants should work on the given task.


## Assignments

- üìë How would you explain to a close relative what you study? Each person, please write down a short explanation in your Google Doc. Besides, please reflect on the challenges you experienced while writing it. (time: 10 minutes)
- üìë Each person, please contact a relative (e.g. your mother or grandfather) and ask him/her to explain to you what you study. Please document the replies in your group‚Äôs Google Doc (e.g. by WhatsApp screenshot, memory protocol, voice message, etc.). (homework)
  *Note: Please do not prepare your conversation partner for this question, but simply give the unfiltered answer.*
