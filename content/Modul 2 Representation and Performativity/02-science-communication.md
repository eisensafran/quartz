> 
> This module is an experiment, where Sarah Tober and Andreas Siess were giving lectures on *Representation and Performativity in Science Communication* in front of engineering students at BITS Pilani in India. Therefore the content is mainly in English and addresses the specific needs and affordances that this experiment demanded.

## Assignment
Science Communication influences our everyday life

What kind of media and what kind of narrative led to this situation that you find yourself sitting here now?
When we first met online, some have participants stated that their family motivated/nudged them to apply for an engineering degree at BITS.

üëâ How did your family come up with this idea?

Which kind of popular media did your parents, your family or your social environment consume that led them to see you as future engineers?

üìë Write some first ideas in your Google doc  (time: 5 minutes)

## Spotlight: The Big Bang Theory

- **Sheldon Cooper**  
  A brilliant but socially awkward theoretical physicist with strict routines and idiosyncratic quirks.
- **Leonard Hofstadter**  
  A kind-hearted experimental physicist who often serves as the emotional center of the group.
- **Howard Wolowitz** 
  A confident aerospace engineer known for his quirky humor, distinctive wardrobe, and over-the-top style.
- **Raj Koothrappali** 
  An astrophysicist with a gentle nature who often struggles with talking to women, adding an endearing awkwardness to his character.
- **Amy Farrah Fowler**  
  A reserved neurobiologist whose gradual journey toward warmth and social engagement deepens her bond with the group.
- **Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz**  
  A petite but assertive microbiologist whose unexpected feistiness complements her sweet demeanor.
## Assignment
üìë Imagine you had to film the next season of The Big Bang Theory and introduce a new character who represents your field of expertise. Write a brief description of this character. What is her name? What is her gender? What distinguishes her? Hobbies? Aspirations? Document your ideas in your shared Google Doc. (homework)
